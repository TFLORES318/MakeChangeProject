## Make Change Project - Week 1 Skill Distillery

### Overview (what the project is, what we are trying to do, how to run it)!

- This project is to compute correct cash back owed and amounts of units of change that are owed to a customer after a purchase is made without exact change. 

- In order to run it, the user will first put in the price of the item. Then, the amount of cash given is entered in. After that, it is determined if the customer paid the correct amount of money, owes more money or paid too little money.

- If the customer is owed money back, the program will print out how much change in each denomination is needed, based on 20s, 10s, 5s, 1s, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.


### Technologies Used 
- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub/Git 

### Lessons Learned
I usually feel confident in math, but using it in coding has been a challenge for me this week. This was great practice to try different operations in order to get the output needed and then choose which program was shorter, more readable and maintainable. I did have to experiment with the numbers a little bit to get to an outcome that worked for all prompts. This was also good practice for me using (if, else) as well as (while loops). I learned how to use Math.round() and get comfortable with it as well as other math functions such as learning how to return two decimal places in changeBack (line 22).
